1. Should the DAO mint additional 50 NFTs into the treasury
2. Increasing the maxMintAmountPerTx to 10, thus allowing more
   minting possible for a given Tx.
3. Changing our DAO name to XYZ
4. Using 1/10th of the DAO funds for XYZ-charity for poor/homeless

2. At any point a person with over 10,000 votes can make
a proposal for the future direction of our platform. A proposal
can be anything, either a proposal to change our logo, to 
changing our name, to adding a new feature, to adding an
artist to the community approved artists, or adjusting our 
fees on our smart contracts. Proposals can be used to enact 
different features on the smart contract, if the community 
wants them, such as the ability to convert their NFTs into ETH,
or to upgrade the DAO into a new smart contract. These are all 
just examples and will be dictated by whoever is making a 
proposal and then of course, if itâ€™s passed.
