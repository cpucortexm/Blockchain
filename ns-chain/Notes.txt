Difference Full nodes vs Miners ? check also https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified#toc-how-miners-and-nodes-handle-bitcoin-transactions

Running a node is just listening for other nodes to pass you data, checking that its valid, and passing it in further.
So a peer will tell you "block 12345573 has parent x, is at height y, has transactions a,b,and c, its nonce is 73626
and its hash is a6h54fwj". When you run a node, your job is to just check that those details are valid and that the hash
lines up and to pass that data onto anyone else that might not know it yet.

When you're mining, you're listening for new transactions, so some random peer will tell you "x wants to send y btc to z,
here's his signature ". And as a miner your job is to collect a few if these, add in the other data above (parent block),
and randomly append millions of possible nonces until the resulting hash follows the rules of the bitcoin network.
Once you have that hash, you transmit that block back to regular nodes to further distribute around the network.


The existing answer is great, but I'd like to provide another perspective.
A (full) node contains the whole block chain. With this knowledge this node can check if new transactions actually are OK.
Furthermore, one can see the number of bitcoins which currently are available for any address. Essentially, a full node can
do what you can see on www.blockchain.info. One typically runs a full node just as a client (as I do on my notebook), or as
a support for the network (as I do on a server) so that thin clients like phones can make use of their knowledge.

Although not strictly necessary, a miner is a full node as above (so with complete knowledge of the block chain) which
additionally creates new blocks. The purpose of new blocks is that new transactions are confirmed, and by making it difficult
to find new blocks one can be (very) sure that there are no other (confirmed) transactions which contradict the transactions
in the new block. These new blocks, if found, are added to the block chain and are available on all full nodes. One typically
runs mining nodes to find blocks and earn the reward of found blocks (currently 25 bitcoins per block).



A 'full node' is a participant on the network that has independently validated the complete copy of the blockchain, and thus
has verified all transactions since the beginning. This requires about 350GB of drive space (currently).

A pruning node is one that has verified all prior transactions; however, it has deleted all blocks below a certain space requirement,
but still has a copy of the UXTO set. It's less useful to the community, but is useful to the node's owner, and takes less resources
on the computer (can be under 1GB of drive space).

A miner on the other hand creates blocks in the blockchain which the nodes keep. Basically, the miner adds transactions to a block,
with the goal of creating a new block with a valid hash that will be accepted by the network. Miners spend about 10 minutes working
on a problem, but nodes keep that result forever after in the database and verify it with others. Miners don't need to know about
prior blocks (except for the prior one) with very few exceptions.

So, a miner is completely different than a full node. It's not comparing the same like things. Full vs Light is comparing two
like things - fruit (apple and orange). Miner vs FullNode is comparing two totally different things (apple and fence).
